# Pondered
Pondered is a full-stack web application that allows users to anonymously share inspirational quotations, personal thoughts, and whatever incites a feeling within them. Users have the ability to engage with each post as well.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express as a framework for Node.js, MongoDB.

This web app began as a simple program to post / get and eventually developed into including the ability to update and delete. Responsivitiy was added later and the ability to submit larger blocks of text without breaking the layout.


## Optimizations:
Down the line, users will have the ability to login and post. While the posts will remain anonymous, deleting a post will become only native to the user that submitted the post in question.

## Lessons learned:
To accomodate varying lengths of text submitted, I developed a deeper understanding of CSS flexbox. I worked through issues with client-side JavaScript surrounding event listeners on the upvote/downvote buttons, learning that NodeList objects are collections of attribute nodes and text nodes in *addition* to element nodes.
